1. Copy the btphone.py code into btphone-gui.py (Don't start sub processes anymore)

(DONE)2. Extract the phone numbers from the <a> tags using Python Beautiful Soup Module and store them into a variable.

3. Save "Scan Results" into a Serialised Multidimentional Array using the Python Pickle module

4. Create PySides6 toolbar at the top of the window and "Scan Selection Window", also create a help screen

5. Create an auto-update tool and make the app check for updates during the initialisation of the btphone-gui.py script

6. Create an "Anti-Spam API" to ensure that not too many requests are made to BT Phone book all at once. (Wouldn't want to inadvertently become a Malware creator).

7. Spin up an Azure Windows 10 Virtual Cloud Machine and use it to compile all the code into an .exe. Also use a MacBook to compile the App into a version that will work on Apple Computers.

8. Create an installation wizard for the build_d version of the app and test both the build_d and build_f versions to make sure that they both work perfectly

9. Cerate a simple website (Maybe github.io) for downloading the App

10. Test Everything!!! Squish the bugs!!
